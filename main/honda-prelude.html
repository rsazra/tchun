<strong>the honda prelude is for me                          nov 05 2025</strong>

<p>I am not a car guy. I frequently watch Doug DeMuro on YouTube, including his weekly podcast <em>This Car Pod!</em>, occasionally peruse discussion on the r/cars subreddit, and am generally vehicularlly curious, but I would never describe myself as a car guy. Recently, on the aforementioned Doug DeMuro podcast, I learned of the new Honda Prelude, slated for a 2026 release. All 3 members of the pod seemed fairly unenthused, as do most commenters I&#39;ve seen on YouTube and Reddit. On the other hand, I think the new Prelude is the best car on the market today.</p>
<p>I think the main cause for disappointment is that the new Prelude is not sporty enough for enthusiast tastes. It&#39;s being compared to the GR86 and ND Miata, which are quite unfavourable matchups from a driving perspective. But I think this is the wrong framing: the Prelude, to me, seems to be a coupe grand tourer.</p>
<p>Recently I&#39;ve been thinking about the ideal vehicle for me (I&#39;m not in the market, I just like to think). Naturally, when thinking about ideals, my mind was mainly on luxury options. The Porsche 911 and 718, ~2020 Acura NSX, or Lucid Air Pure. I decided my favourite was the Aston Martin Vantage; unquestionably a sports car, but—as expected from Aston Martin—with the DNA of a touring car. The Vantage is beautiful, small, quick, comfortable, modern and relatively understated. The only gripe I had was with fuel economy, especially compared to the hybrids and EVs that are common today. </p>
<p>I would summarize the Prelude as a budget Vantage, arguably even with some improvements. A small hybrid engine for fuel economy, Honda&#39;s legacy for reliability/a fair price, FWD for practicality (a key choice for usability in snowy conditions), and an automatic transmission for accessibility/comfort on longer drives. I wouldn&#39;t change any of this (well, maybe I would prefer AWD to FWD, but I&#39;m not sure what the tradeoffs really are). </p>
<p>To address some other common criticisms: the pricing (despite not being officially announced) is already being touted as too high. But given the approach of offering only a single trim level, I think a high price would be somewhat justified if you think of it not as a base model, but the highest trim. I think I like this, but we&#39;ll see how the execution is. Second, 200 HP is being ridiculed for matching the number of the previous Prelude. While I understand the frustration, it&#39;s hard to imagine the car being much slower than the Civic it&#39;s based on, and while that is by no means a high bar to clear, I would say it&#39;s good enough for me. </p>
<p>I really wish I could buy one, but unfortunately I&#39;m just not at a place in life to be buying a brand new car. Maybe in a few years I&#39;ll be able to get a nice used one for cheap. Until then, I&#39;ll be sure to update this site (and perhaps even this page) if my preferences change.</p>

<strong>thoughts on luxury watches                           dec 07 2025</strong>

<p class="aside">Disclaimer: This is speculation based on what I&#39;ve read on the internet. I don&#39;t actually know that much about the history of watches, luxury, or luxury watches. If you have knowledge, please email me with more info!</p>
<p>Most watch nerds will spend some time learning about the world of vintage watches. Years ago, upon my first research, I was surprised at the inconsistency of it. Two watches could have the same reference number but look drastically different! It seems there are a few reasons for this, but they can be summarized by appreciating the smaller scale of yesterday&#39;s luxury watch industry. They were making fewer watches, and so, the sale cycle was quite different.</p>
<p>A brand would release a catalogue outlining their collections. This would include the variations of the watches: dial colours, lug shapes, handsets, etc. Boutiques would then choose some variations to keep in stock, and individuals could order a watch directly from the brand exactly to their liking. </p>
<p class="aside">See <a href="https://goldammer.me/blogs/articles/omega-constellation-guide-pie-pan">this article on vintage Omega Constellations</a> for concrete examples on references and their variations.</p>
<p>My reaction to realizing this was instant disappointment. To customize a watch today requires a relationship with the brand, which is generally only created through consistent purchases (i.e. immense wealth). I find it ironic: the people that get to customize their watches have dozens in their collection. If I, a regular guy, want just one or two watches to last the rest of my life, I have to pick something cookie cutter.</p>
<p>Of course, there are a handful of brands still making bespoke watches. It is rare, and these watches are quite expensive, but some are realistically attainable for many middle-class people (at some point in their lifetime, if they prioritize it). My favourite example is <a href="https://www.lainewatches.com/">Laine</a>, specifically their <a href="https://www.lainewatches.com/v38">V38 Guilloche</a>. Lately I&#39;ve been dreaming about how I&#39;d spec it if — and hopefully when — I have the funds.</p>
<p class="aside">The current plan would be silvered-coloured dial and Breguet numerals, standard lance/leaf hands but heat-treated to purple (seen on <a href="https://instagram.com/laine_watches">their Instagram page</a>, but not listed on their website), Guilloche Pattern A (Panier – Grain de riz – Clou de Paris going from outer dial – inner dial – seconds register), simple frosting on the movement bridges, and a custom logo in the rotor (it&#39;s something like the favicon on this page, but I must keep it secret).</p>
                              ----

<p>Some more takes:</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://laurentferrier.ch/collections/classic">Laurent Ferrier&#39;s Classic watches</a> have the best case in the game, and the best crown (love that onion)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.krayon.ch/index.php?lang=en">Krayon&#39;s</a> innovation is amazing, and I wonder if their complications will be co-opted by cheaper upstarts (the <a href="https://www.krayon.ch/anyday.php?lang=en">Anyday</a> doesn&#39;t seem that hard to copy, and the <a href="https://www.krayon.ch/anywhere.php?lang=en">Anywhere</a> is just so cool I think it could be worth it)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.parmigiani.com/en/">Parmigiani Fleurier</a> is underrated. The <a href="https://www.parmigiani.com/en/collections/tonda-pf/">Tonda PF</a> collection is, in my opinon, the best overall &quot;integrated bracelet sports watch&quot; overall<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.audemarspiguet.com/com/en/collections/royal-oak-collection.html">Audemars Piguet&#39;s Royal Oak</a> and<a href="https://www.vacheron-constantin.com/ww/en/collections/historiques/4200h-222a-b934.html"> Vacheron Constantin&#39;s 222</a> are close, and have nicer bracelets, but the Tonda PF&#39;s proportions, movement, and simplicity just kill</li>
<li>Actually I just remembered the <a href="https://www.alange-soehne.com/eu-en/timepieces/odysseus/odysseus">Lange Odysseus</a>... that&#39;s also up there...</li>
<li>On the topic of &quot;integrated bracelet steel sports watches&quot;, I&#39;m surprised the <a href="https://h-moser.com/collections/streamliner/">H. Moser &amp; Cie Streamliner Collection</a> is not more popular among young people — this would make so much sense on Young Thug, Future, Yeat and so many more</li>
</ul></li><li>I would rather have vintage Tudor than vintage Rolex for the rose logo, old Tudor typography, the same beautiful Oyster cases, and sometimes text that looks like a smiley face on the lower half (<a href="https://theoandharris.com/shop/vintage-watches-sold/tudor-oyster-prince-12/">example</a>, but I don&#39;t like the fluted bezel, gold case, handset or indices on this lol)</li>
<li>There are not enough flat-bezel'd watches. <a href="https://kikuchi-nakagawa.com/en/">Kikuchi Nakagawa</a> is the only one I can think of in the world of haute horology. Beyond luxury, <a href="https://baltic-watches.com/en/collections/mr">Baltic&#39;s MR01</a> is an option, but both deviate from the inspiration (<a href="https://www.watchclub.com/patek-philippe/calatrava/ref96earlysteelmodel-ref-96-year-1935">Patek Philippe&#39;s original Calatrava, the 96</a> or 570) in an important way: the bezels are polished rather than radially brushed. This makes it way flashier, and in my opinion, almost ruins the watch. I am very close to adding the Baltic MR01 to my &quot;to-buy&quot; list. I&#39;ve accepted the off-centre seconds subdial, but I just don&#39;t know if I can reconcile with the polished bezel. The only place I&#39;ve seen it done right is on <a href="https://www.archiwatch.com/collections/the-original-collection">The Archiwatch</a>, which also gives some models the leaf hands I adore. Of course, these (like Kikuchi Nakagawa&#39;s timepieces) are extremely difficult to acquire. If you know of any watches with brushed and flat bezels, please let me know! I&#39;m sure more exist, especially vintage ones, but I&#39;m not sure how to find them. </li>
<li>Modern <a href="https://www.cartier.com/en-ca/watches/collections/">Cartier</a> has painfully declined (<a href="https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/a-collectors-guide-to-vintage-1970s-cartier-watches">Old Santos &gt; new, Tank Normale &gt; any other Tank</a>), and vintage Cartier has become overpriced (trendy)</li>
<li>Constant force movement modifications are better and cooler than a tourbillon (Fusee and Chain movements are sick)</li>
<li>Power reserve indicators are good, and should be more common — especially on manually-wound watches</li>
<li>Spring Drive is super cool, but the watches that have it just aren&#39;t that compelling to me</li>
<li>I love micro-rotors</li>
</ul>

<strong>why i spend money on stuff, not experiences          sep 25 2025</strong>

<p>The general advice is to do the opposite. Reject frivolous purchases like clothes or jewellery, spend your money on concerts! Travel! Hanging out with friends and going on &quot;adventures&quot;! </p>
<p>The obvious argument against this is that there is value in investing in yourself. Buy a nice bed, eat healthy food, get a good toothbrush, et cetera.</p>
<p>But delving deeper, I think this glosses over the mindset of people like me. I love my things. At the surface I&#39;m sure this sounds materialistic, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the right word (and if it is, then I don&#39;t think it&#39;s inherently bad). The best way to describe it is as an experience itself: I buy beautiful clothes for the <em>experience</em> of wearing them. I buy nice pens for the <em>experience</em> of writing with them. I buy great knives for the <em>experience</em> of cooking with them. Some of my clothes make me happy not only when they are on my back, but even when I see them in my closet! Additionally, these are experiences that <em>last</em>. The traditional concept of purchasing experiences are inherently fleeting. But my memory is fallible, and my moments of reminiscence rare. I also might have anxiety, and tend to ruin the traditional experiences by stressing over trying to optimize the value I gain from them (eg., trying to remember every detail, wondering what to do next).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve discussed this much with the people of my life and a friend made an interesting argument: Perhaps I should seek to be content with regular clothes, pens and knives. How much better is the <em>experience</em> of writing with a $100 pen compared to one you&#39;d get from a 20-pack for $12.99? This gave me pause, but there are rebuttals. For one, even if the experience is slightly better, it compounds over time with each use. And in contrast, how much better is a football game seen live vs. viewing it at home?</p>
<p>Ultimately, it seems this is a matter of opinion. Some will seek joy in special moments, and others (like myself) will chase making <em>every</em> moment the best it can be. I just wish my path was more accepted and I wouldn&#39;t face flack for saying things like &quot;I don&#39;t like hiking&quot;.</p>
<p>Apparently there is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/travisbradberry/2016/08/09/why-you-should-spend-your-money-on-experiences-not-things/">research</a> contrary to my position, but 1) I am always suspicious of soft science studies, 2) the general case does not always apply, and 3) the general opinion/reaction is not always the <em>correct</em> opinion/reaction. If it is true that for most people spending money on experiences is more valuable than spending on things, is that a good thing? Or would a shift in perspective be beneficial? I would love to hear your thoughts!</p>
